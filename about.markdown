# About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fredrik Warfvinge, a DevOps IT Consultant based in the vibrant city of Stockholm, Sweden. By day, I contribute my skills and expertise to the innovative team at Iver Accelerate AB, where I immerse myself in the dynamic world of IT.

## Professional Background

### Work and Location
- **Current Role:** DevOps IT Consultant
- **Company:** Iver Accelerate AB
- **Location:** Stockholm, Sweden

### Focus Areas
In the vast landscape of IT, I specialize in the following areas:
- **Security:** Ensuring digital landscapes are fortified and resilient.
- **Automation:** Streamlining processes to boost efficiency and reliability.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Believing in the power of shared wisdom to propel the entire community forward.

### Technology Landscape
I thrive in the realm of multi-cloud solutions, GitOps, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). My toolkit predominantly revolves around the HashiCorp stack of products, as I find their solutions to be both powerful and elegant.

## Blogging Mission

This blog serves as my way of sharing demos, presentations from talks and similar. Heavily focused on what I do at work, and a lot of them are more proof of concepts or purely for training purposes. Don't expect anything on this blog to be production ready, as those are developed specifically based upon customer needs. 

Feel free to join me on this journey of continuous learning, as we navigate the complexities of technology together.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something valuable in the pages of this blog!
